==================================
NEAR FUTURE SPACECRAFT PACK v0.4.3
==================================

This pack contains spacecraft parts. It includes two command pods, a utility/crew container, three orbital engines, a landing leg pod, several RCS blocks and two service fuel tanks.

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place some parts in new nodes.
